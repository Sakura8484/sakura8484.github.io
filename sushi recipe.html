    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 nori seaweed warps</li>
        <li>2 cups of sushi rice, 80ml of rice vinegar </li>
      <li>1 red orange, and yellow bell pepper, sliced thinly</li>
<li>1 carrot peeled and julienned</li>
<li>1 mango sliced into thin strips</li>
<li>1 avocado sliced into thin strips</li>
<li>1 cucumber sliced into thin strips</li>
<li>½ cup shredded purple cabbage </li>
        </ul>
    
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put all the ingredients into a blender</li>    
        <li>Blend on high speed till mixture is smooth and cohesive</li>
      <li>Combine the 2 cups uncooked sushi rice with 4 cups water.</li>
<li>Cover with a tight fitting lid and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and allow to simmer on low for 10 minutes. After 10 minute turn off the heat and allow to sit for another 10 minutes - keep the LID on. 
Meanwhile, prepare the rest of the ingredients by slicing them as thin as you can. </li>
<li>When the rice is done cooking, stir in the rice vinegar and place it in a bowl to cool down slightly.</li>
<li> Place a nori sheet on to the bamboo rolling mat (make sure that the pieces of bamboo are horizontal so you can roll it).</li> 
<li>Wet your hands in a bowl of warm water and place a small amount of rice on the nori and pat it into a thin layer to cover the nori. You want a continuous and even layer rice while still keeping it thin.
Add your fillings in a line about 1/3 of the way from the bottom of the nori roll.</li>
<li>Start to roll the bamboo/nori up - they will roll kind of like cinnamon rolls, but make sure to keep the bamboo mat on the outside and don't add it into your roll. 
  As you roll, squeeze and compress the bamboo mat to compress and tighten the roll. </li>
<li>When complete, remove the bamboo mat and slice into coins with a super sharp knife</li>
